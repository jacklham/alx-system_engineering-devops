In the context of DevOps, processes and signals play a crucial role in managing and controlling the execution of programs, especially in a distributed and automated environment.

**Processes in DevOps**:
Processes in DevOps are about the various activities involved in the software development lifecycle. This includes coding, building, testing, packaging, releasing, configuring, and monitoring. Each of these activities can be considered a process in the DevOps context. For example, a GitHub repository named "alx-system_engineering-devops" contains scripts that demonstrate various process-related tasks such as displaying its own PID, listing currently running processes, and managing processes and PID files.

**Signals in DevOps**:
Signals in the context of DevOps are often used for inter-process communication in a distributed system. They are used to notify a process about a particular event or to instruct it to perform a certain action. For instance, in the same GitHub repository, there are scripts that demonstrate signal handling, such as a script that displays "To infinity and beyond" indefinitely until it receives a SIGTERM signal.

In a broader sense, DevOps encourages practices like continuous integration, delivery, and deployment. These practices enable collaboration throughout the entire development pipeline from concept and build to deployment and testing. Automation is a key principle of DevOps, and it often extends to operations with a focus on tooling to accomplish faster deployment.
